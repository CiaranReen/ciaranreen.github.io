A lot changed for me in 2017. Overall it's been a great year for me - I've left my comfort zone on numerous occasions and (most of time) it paid off. Here's a roundup of the big stuff.

### Leaving Sky

Leaving Sky was, by far, the biggest decision of my career so far. It was (and still is) an amazing place to work but I felt like I needed a change. Eventually I found a "nice" time to leave: just after the launch of our broadband diagnostic tool which was my team's largest and most complex project to date.

When I joined Sky in July 2015 it had a real startup feel in Leeds (the London offices were well established), and I saw the place grow and thrive during my two years there. I'd encourage anyone thinking of joining to get involved, as it's a melting pot of knowledge.

### Contracting

When planning my next career move, contracting was something I briefly thought of, but I honestly thought it would be one or two job moves down the line. I applied for perm jobs, believing that was what my next role would be. It was only until my last week of Sky that I was approached by jet2.com to help build their frontend portion of their new redesign.

A couple of phone calls later and I was offered it, to start that Monday for an initial 2 months. I was there for total of 5 and got a real feel for contracting and running a business alongside my every day work. It was working here that I decided I wanted to continue contracting and growing my client portfolio going forward.

I now work for Purple, just outside Manchester city centre, working with some ace people day-in day-out on a complete rebuild of their dashboard. Which brings me to my last big change.

### Changing city

Leaving Leeds, which had been my home for 6 years, to go and live in Manchester. I went to university in Leeds in 2011 (fresher's week still feels like yesterday), lived all over the place, made friends for life and generally had the best experience I could ask for. The memories I've made in Leeds will last a lifetime. So I moved to Manchester with a heavy heart but a new city meant new challenges and new opportunities to tackle. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what I can accomplish here.

### Travelling

They say when you go travelling once you get the "travel bug" and that very much happened this year for me. I've been away 5 times this year: Ibiza, Amsterdam, Berlin, Mexico, and Paris. I'd revisit any of them again, albeit for different reasons.

Going into 2018 I want to travel to SE Asia as that's something I've wanted to do for a few years now. We're thinking of flying into Tokyo, down through South Korea and then into Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.



And that's my 2017 in a nutshell. Here's to a great 2018!
